For technical reasons related to my project, I am only interested in counting the spots in the middle of the grid. 
The corner spots are meant to serve as reference points and are not counted in this script.

For scale: Each spot is spaced roughly 20 nm apart in grid. Each pixel in image should correspond to roughly 2nm in size.
